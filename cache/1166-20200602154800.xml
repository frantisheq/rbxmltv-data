The two have performed in the same bands since the 1960s and have been romantic partners for more than two decades. Watching them perform is the definition of musical telepathy. A glance or a smile seems to change the feel of the music. In 1988, Swallow and Bley began performing duet concerts in Europe, United States, South America and Japan. This performance of Duets, their album of songs arranged for piano and bass, was released that same year. The performance showcases their approach to traditional jazz, folk and classical music, as well as their poignant musical story.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200602/1410020783-Duets-carla-bley-and-steve-swallow-in-1988</w></i><x></x></a>
