They prefer to achieve the highest level by composing original music, creating unique arrangements, and playing inventively as well as passionately. In fact, it really is jazz with a dynamic orchestral sound, with a classic strength in which each musician is also a brilliant soloist. Call it an 'orchestrated passion for jazz' that incites BJO to create world-class music. Founded in 1993 by Frank Vaganée, Serge Plume and Marc Godfroid, the Brussels Jazz Orchestra is recognised and has been subsidised by the Flemish Government since. Brussels Jazz Orchestra is orchestra in residence at Flagey in Brussels.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200606/1410026417-Brussels-jazz-orchestra-bert-joris-big-valses</w></i><x></x></a>
