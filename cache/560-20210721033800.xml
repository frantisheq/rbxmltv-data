When Austria's Emperor Leopold II went to the congress city of Frankfurt to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1790, Mozart hoped to be honored with a commission for a coronation work. The results were disastrous: Antonio Salieri received the commission for a coronation opera and Mozart was asked to write and perform a piano concerto for the coronation ceremonies, a work that was virtually ignored at the time of its creation. In this episode, soloist Radu Lupu performs Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 19, KV 459 with the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie, under the baton of David Zinman. The recording took place at the Imperial Hall in Munich.</d></p><i><t>Seri√°l</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210721/1540230440-Mozart-on-tour-episode-11-frankfurt</w></i><x></x></a>
