Even as Bruckner began working on it in 1887, his health had begun to fail. He expressed the hope that &quot;God will grant me enough time to complete it,&quot; and worked on it assiduously over the next years. But by late 1894 he had completed only the first three movements. When he died on 11 October 1896, he left six different versions of the finale, all of them incomplete. Despite its incompleteness, the work is monumental and evokes the grandeur of a majestic cathedral. The details of this architectural colossus are worked out with astonishing transparency by Franz Welser-Möst and the Cleveland Orchestra. The orchestra's powerfully contoured and sharply profiled interpretation was recorded live in late October 2007 at the magnificent &quot;Golden Hall&quot; of Vienna's fabled Musikverein where the work was given its premiere.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210716/1540146838-Bruckner-symphony-no-9</w></i><x></x></a>
