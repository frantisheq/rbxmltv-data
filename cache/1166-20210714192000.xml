(2015)</k><d>The MotorMusic Studios in Mechelen, Belgium, attract many great musicians to the city. A wide variety of visiting international jazz musicians share their art of making jazz music with us in the DJAZZ series 'Belgium Sessions'. In these sessions, some of Europe's finest musicians perform their own, original music. The Dutch-Belgian acoustic-electronic piano threesome 'De Beren Gieren' ('The Bears Shriek', 'Les Ours Vautours') are known for their unique energetic sound, sparkling melodies, complex song structures and quirky song titles. 'De Beren Gieren' brings a fresh yet familiar blend of polyrhythmic soundscapes, sing-alongs, and elitist twists, building a sonorous bridge between early 20th century classical compositions and more contemporary escapades. 'De Beren Gieren' show an ability to change mood quite suddenly in a way that constantly holds the audience's attention. A surprising live experience not to be missed!</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210714/1540125565-Motormusic-jazz-sessions-de-beren-gieren</w></i><x></x></a>
