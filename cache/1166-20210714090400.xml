His early and highly successful experiments blending jazz and rock music charted a path that led to the electric fusion of Miles Davis and The Headhunters, while his exploration of spirituality and transcendental meditation added a new depth to his sound. Lloyd moves from hard swing to subtle ballads, blending gorgeous textures and Eastern influences. This 1966 recording features Lloyd's quartet, accompanied by Keith Jarrett (piano), Cecil McBee (double bass) and Jack DeJohnette (drums), playing some of Lloyd's own compositions.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210714/1540125555-Charles-lloyd-quartet-live-in-brussels</w></i><x></x></a>
