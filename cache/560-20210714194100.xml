Take a trip with the Mozart family to the Italian Alps where they encountered a culture that would influence Wolfgang Amadeus' music forever. The &quot;Manzuoli style&quot; of virtuoso singing, the Italian school of composition, and the pianoforte had a profound impact on Mozart' s creativity. Two of Mozart's earliest piano concerti were &quot;pasticcio&quot; arrangements for piano and orchestra, based on works by other composers. Even at this early age, his works possessed the indelible imprint of the sublime musical master. Discover the soloist Heidrun Holtmann as she performs Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 1, KV 37 and Piano Concerto No. 4, KV 41, accompanied by the Orchestra della Radiotelevisione della Svizzera. Conducted by Marc Andreae, the performance took place at the historic Teatro Bibiena in Mantua.</d></p><i><t>Seri√°l</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210714/1540120429-Mozart-on-tour-episode-2-mantua</w></i><x></x></a>
