Režie: Armel Hostiou.</k><d>Armel Hostiou’s haunting study of urban alienation follows three characters—a woman, a man, and a child—over the period of a single day in Paris. They don’t know each other and they won’t cross paths, but they share an insidious feeling of confinement. Because of an external event, each of them will leave their environment and undergo an experience that confronts them with the uncomfortable and dangerous dimensions of their shared urban space. Through its patient observation of the quotidian, of the passage of time from morning to night, Day reacquaints us with the strangeness of everyday life.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/filmbox-arthouse/20190715/1300158190-Day</w></i><x></x></a>
