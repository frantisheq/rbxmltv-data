As winners of the Classic Prague Awards in 2017 for 'Best Crossover Project', the quartet combines their classic music training and clarinet art with jazz, minimalism and improvisation to create their very own music without borders, capable of communicating directly with all audiences. The Clarinet Factory also experiment with electronics, both ambient and dance-oriented, and the four musicians remain ever fascinated with the possibilities of their instrument, considering their work as a music laboratory. Regularly collaborating with symphonic ensembles, vocalists, performance artists, the quartet have written music for film, theatre, ballet and contemporary dance. In this performance from 2019's Classical:NEXT!, the ensemble interprets their own works: &quot;Bird Song&quot;, &quot;Husa divoká&quot;, &quot;B-A-C-H&quot;, &quot;Hikari&quot;, &quot;Luda's Dance&quot; and &quot;L'Amour&quot;. The Clarinet Factory is made up of Vojtěch Nýdl (clarinet and vocals), Luděk Boura (clarinet), Jindřich Pavliš (clarinet), and Petr Valášek (bass clarinet).</d></p><i><t>Seriál</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210713/1540096736-Classical-next-2019-clarinet-factory</w></i><x></x></a>
