In 1791, with his life cruelly and rapidly ending, Mozart once again turned to the compositional style which reflected his personality: the concerto for piano and orchestra. His last piano concerto, which turned out to be an uplifting composition, regales its audience with a lyrical children's song, invoking the joys of youth and springtime. In a fitting finale to this series, soloist Aleksander Madzar and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra directed by Andre Previn join forces in a performance of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 27, KV 595, recorded at Vienna's Schönbrunn palace.</d></p><i><t>Seriál</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210714/1540120421-Mozart-on-tour-episode-13-vienna-iii</w></i><x></x></a>
