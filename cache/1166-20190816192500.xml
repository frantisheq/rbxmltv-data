2015. Shayna Steele. BIRD, Rotterdam, The Netherlands</k><d>Rotterdam's ' BIRD' is a club, café and restaurant with a live music programme that's deeply rooted in jazz, and also branches out towards soul, funk, hip-hop and electronic music as well. Its name 'BIRD' refers to the nickname of the legendary New York jazz saxophonist, bebop co-founder Charlie Parker (1920-1955). BIRD serves Neapolitan pizzas, good wines, no-nonsense beers and an all-round metropolitan rawness. Since 2014, this urban jazz club and DJAZZ.tv have been collaborating for a series of music programmes: 'BIRD.tv', allowing you to experience the best BIRD concerts and interviews as from a first row seat! In today's episode Shayna Steele, who can do everything: from background singing with Rihanna via the big Broadway Show on to guest songstress on hit singles by Moby. In order to do so much at once, a versatile voice is a must. And it is exactly this versatility that the American songstress delivers at her concerts, without ever losing the musical direction. From swinging acoustic Samba to storming guitar funk, everything fits like a mould. Presented with a generous portion of charm and impressive dynamic.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190816/1310273267-Birdtv-shayna-steele</w></i><x></x></a>
