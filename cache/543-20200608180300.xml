Milky Chance is the success story of two school friends, Clemens Rehbein and Philipp Dausch. After a long break, 2017 marks the release of a second, long-waited, album &quot;Blossom&quot;. And, for the public, finally the occasion to discover live these new compositions, mixing rock, folk and electro pop. With reggae vibrations that can rub shoulders with house elements, Milky Chance has one of the most singular sounds. With the presence of musicians on stage, and if we believe the listening of the new record, we can expect more electric concerts, more electronic and even more energetic than in the past!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200608/1410081814-Garorock-festival-2017</w></i><x></x></a>
