It has to go in there, this has to be a song.” Every song has its own story, and we all think it’s a story we’ve heard before, but we haven’t. Songbook finds and captures these intriguing stories by pulling you into the process of writing and composing. Known for its pristine sound, cinematic 4k video and eye for detail, Songbook live-captured episodes emphasize the paramount importance of quality. It addresses the on-the-spot elements of blending song and location at the right moment. Both the magical location and remarkable music interaction will get the attention they deserve. Simply because Songbook isn’t just a live music session, it lives. This episode of Songbook features Dutch producer, DJ and innovator San Holo, born Sander van Dijck. On his LP, simply titled &quot;album1&quot;, the 28 year-old combines danceable EDM with elements of indie. Before releasing music of his own, he gave guitar lessons to children while studying music production and guitar at Rotterdam's Codarts University for the Arts . While remaining faithful to the guitar, San Holo now also uses his vocals and electronic elements to create unique sounscapes, captivating listerners on the dancefloor and in atmospheric acoustic performances alike.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200423/1390461063-Songbook-san-holo</w></i><x></x></a>
