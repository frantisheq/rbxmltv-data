This work is one of the most popular and frequently performed horn concertos written in the 19th century, and the first orchestral piece the composer wrote for the instrument. Strauss' father, Franz, was a virtuoso horn player, and one of the leading performers of his time. Also featured in this program are performances of Beethoven's immortal Symphony No. 7 and Schoenberg's early work Verkl√§rte Nacht. The soloist for Strauss' virtuoso Horn Concerto is the DNSO's principal horn player Lasse Mauritzen.
