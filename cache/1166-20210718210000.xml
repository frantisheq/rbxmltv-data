Although the festival's name suggests a strong focus on piano music, it featured countless famous musicians from jazz and classical music – not just pianists. The concerts were usually held in July at The Gasteig, home of the Munich Philharmonic. In 1994, legendary swing band leader and vibraphonist Lionel Hampton performed his own arrangements of jazz standards with Junior Mance on piano, Jimmy Woode on bass and Bobby Durham on drums. They were joined by the St. Petersburg State Orchestra conducted by Alexander Tschernuschenko, to create an exciting big band sound on rousing performances of 'In the Mood' and 'Air Mail Special'. The program ends with Hampton singing Louis Armstrong's latter-day hit 'What a Wonderful World'.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210718/1540177938-Lionel-hampton-m-nchner-klaviersommer</w></i><x></x></a>
