With the musicians of Fela Kuti's legendary band Egypt 80, Seaun Kuti brings the most original incarnation of Afrobeat to life. Digging deep into different African traditions, Seun has brought his own touch to the music by reflecting the difficulties and cultures of the continent. Three-quarters of Egypt 80's current line-up is composed of musicians who didn't only play with Fela Kuti, but often were arrested and harassed alongside the founder of the Afrobeat.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210716/1540152256-Seun-kuti-egypt-80-cabaret-sauvage</w></i><x></x></a>
