The matter that built skies and seas, the atoms that make up you and me, the chemistry around us that forms the things we touch, smell and see. This series shows us what the objects in our universe and in our homes are made from and why the particles around us behave as they do. Everything around us is built from Everyday Elements.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20210713/1540227842-Everyday-elements-ep-04</w></i><x></x></a>
