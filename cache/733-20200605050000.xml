The character, created by Prosper Mérimée in a novel published in 1847, acquired international fame with the opera of Georges Bizet, one of the most performed operas in the world. The documentary takes us on the road from Andalusia to Seville, a source of inspiration for Prosper Mérimée. The natural settings are superimposed with those of the opera. Footage of Carmen's rehearsals and performances by Opera 2001 are punctuated by interviews with Carmen's supporting performers, who play Don José, Micaëla, Escamillo. Their vision of the characters is deepened by scholars of Merimee's literature and Bizet's music.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200605/1410106587-Carmen-what-a-story</w></i><x></x></a>
