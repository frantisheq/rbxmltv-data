Their consistently smooth, warm, and lush harmonies set The Brothers Four apart from others. They turned professional as a result of a practical joke. A member of a competing fraternity arranged for a woman to telephone the band members, identifying herself as the secretary to the manager of Seattle's Colony Club and inviting the quartet down for an audition. As soon as The Brothers Four got there, they found that there was no invitation or any audition scheduled â€“ but since they were there anyway, the club manager asked them to play a few songs and ended up hiring them. A few years later, The Brothers Four appeared at a short-lived Belgian jazz festival in Comblain-la-Tour, where they sang the entire book of American Folk Songs.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210717/1540162160-The-brothers-four-live-in-comblain-la-tour</w></i><x></x></a>
