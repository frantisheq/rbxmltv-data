He presumably wrote these sonata's for Prince Leopold, later adapting them for his own purposes in Leipzig. This would explain why the sonatas, which are sophisticated enough to challenge the most experienced of musicians, are at the same time perfectly playable for amateurs. The several pieces were meant to be a set just like the Brandenburg concertos. This third sonata follows a typical 'Italian' pattern: slow – fast – slow – fast.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210716/1540146835-Bach-sonata-no-3-bwv-1016</w></i><x></x></a>
