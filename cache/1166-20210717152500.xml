Bing Crosby would often attend these sessions. Musicians would say he was 'jammin' the beat', as he clapped on the first and the third beat, rather than the second and the fourth. Now, in the 21th century, DJAZZ takes this 'jamming' into a whole new dimension with Seine Sessions. The creme de la creme of the Paris jazz, blues, gypsy and funk scene performs at the legendary club annex restaurant Le Resevoir. And what's more: these artists never played with each other on stage before! This episode 'World Music', presented by Eddy King, shows unique performances and interviews of among Teófilo Chantre, Tiwitine and Kinsy Ray.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210717/1540162156-Seine-sessions-world-music</w></i><x></x></a>
