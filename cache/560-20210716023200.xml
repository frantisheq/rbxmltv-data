Under the baton of Sir Simon Rattle, the renowned orchestra performs Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo's beloved Concierto de Aranjuez, Emmanuel Chabrier's exuberant Espana, and Sergey Rachmaninov's dramatic Second Symphony. For the first piece, the orchestra is joined by famous flamenco guitarist Canizares, whose virtuosity and sensitivity are on full display in this multi-faceted and subtle work. The soloist's virtuosity, his technique, harmony, strength and sensitivity have distinguished Canizares as a unique artist, considered one of the great flamenco musicians of the turn of the century. Above anything else, however, Canizares praises simplicity and purity of sound, transmitting a message with a high emotional impact, as is proven in this splendid concert.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210716/1540146824-Europakonzert-2011-madrid</w></i><x></x></a>
