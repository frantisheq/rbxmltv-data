Režie: Edgar Honetschlager.</k><d>‘If you drink this juice, you'll make it to a hundred’ says the young man to his old neighbor, who replies: ‘I got to a hundred without this juice, didn’t I?’ Humor and wit form the basis of a friendship that bridges a huge age difference and allows the centenarian to resume: ‘For me the best part of life is being old’. A travelling artist, painter and filmmaker has a centenarian neighbour. The relationship between this man in his forties and the solitary old lady with a wicked sense of humour gradually becomes a kind of elective kinship. Their discussions, interrupted and picked up again over the years, form the fabric of this personal, tender and surprising film. A calm observation on the inescapable power of the passage of time.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/filmbox-arthouse/20210719/1540226307-Omsch</w></i><x></x></a>
