The work is divided into eight sections that give the greatest prominence to the chorus while also containing impressive solos, especially for soprano and tenor. Completely unexpected is the startlingly wild and furious organ solo (Iveta Apklana at the organ) that follows the Ordinary of the Mass and precedes the final movement. Janáček, who achieved worldwide celebrity late in life, wanted to emphasize the common bonds between the Slavic nations by writing the text in Old Church Slavonic, which used an alphabet devised by Saints Cyril and Methodius called 'Glagolitic'. The choice of this ancient language also reflects the Moravian composer's sympathies with the Slavic nations that were under the yoke of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210715/1540136671-Janacek-glagolitic-mass</w></i><x></x></a>
