Their art helps them define themselves, together and separately, and helps us redefine our idea of what is possible. SOAR celebrates the extraordinary ways that Kiera has learned to adapt and reveals Uriahâ€™s part in helping her sister adjust. Tension arises when Uriah steps away, finally admitting her need to define herself as an individual. But a dance concert reunites them, rekindling their powerful bond as artists and sisters.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20210713/1540227848-Soar</w></i><x></x></a>
