An unprecedented event: a solo piano concert at the home base of football club Ajax Amsterdam! During the concert, the sound of a seagull or an aeroplane might mingle with the gentle touch of the Dutch master pianist. A must-see concert for all fans of piano music, with a wonderful encore: a performance of Thelonious Monk's famous standard 'Round Midnight'.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200605/1410023428-Michiel-borstlap-blue-reflective-frames</w></i><x></x></a>
