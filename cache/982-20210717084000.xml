Režie: Buster Keaton, Clyde Bruckman.</k><d>Rejected by the Confederate army and taken for a coward by his beloved Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack), young Johnny Gray (Keaton) is given a chance to redeem himself when Yankee spies steal his cherished locomotive. Johnny wages a one-man war against hijackers, an errant cannon and the unpredictable hand of fate while roaring along the iron rails. &quot;Every shot has the authenticity and the unassuming correct composition of a Mathew Brady Civil War photograph,&quot; wrote film historian David Robinson, &quot;No one - not even Griffith or Huston and certainly not Fleming (Gone With the Wind) - caught the visual aspect of the Civil War as Keaton did.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/filmbox-arthouse/20210717/1540226266-The-general</w></i><x></x></a>
