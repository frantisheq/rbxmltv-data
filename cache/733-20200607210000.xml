Volcanoes have produced many of the most valuable minerals - and most of the arable soil on earth. Every day, they are exploding around the world. When the Yellowstone Super Volcano blows (and it is now 48,000 years overdue to do so), it will destroy most of life on North America. Award-winning filmmaker Peter Rowe has climbed and filmed 19 volcanoes, and tells the story of them, the adventures of climbing them, the people who live beside them, and the scientists who risk their lives to study them, in &quot;Volcanic Planet&quot;. He also convinces his climbing partner George Kourounis to get married (!?) on the exploding lip of one of them. Filmed in Congo, Iceland, Italy, Vanuatu, Hawaii, Tonga, Turkey, Guatemala, New Zealand, Costa Rica and under the Pacific Ocean, &quot;Volcanic Planet&quot; is a fast-paced high-voltage tour of the world’s most active smoking mountains.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200607/1410106676-Volcanic-planet</w></i><x></x></a>
