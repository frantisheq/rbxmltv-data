After having visited the capital, we go to Punta Arenas, the southernmost city of the South American country, it is the capital of Chilean Antarctica. Itâ€™s port looks out over the Straits of Magellan and as we sail towards the &quot;end of the world&quot; on board an expedition ship we enter Tierra del Fuego where in Ainsworth Bay we meet a fascinating colony of elephant seals. A nature guide together with a biologist help us understand the world of these rather unknown animals, revealing to us their secrets and behaviour patterns. And this is only the first part of a long adventure.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20210719/1540228029-Around-the-world-in-80-islands</w></i><x></x></a>
