This piece is nicknamed &quot;Farewell&quot; because of a funny anecdote. Haydn and his musicians stayed every year from May to October at the magnificent Esterh√°azy Palace, at the request of Prince Nicholas. In early November 1772, the prince announced his intention to remain at the palace for two more months. The musicians then told Kapellmeister Haydn their disagreement with this forced extension of their stay. The solution proposed by Haydn was to compose a piece delivering a clear message: at the end of the last movement of the Symphony, the musicians were called to blow the candles on their lectern and leave the room one after the other. Prince Nicholas understood the message; the next day a car was waiting for the musicians to take them home.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210714/1540120423-Haydn-symphony-no-45-farewell</w></i><x></x></a>
