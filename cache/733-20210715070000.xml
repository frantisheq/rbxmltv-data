After four long years of negotiation with his brideâ€™s family, he is now ready to get married. The preparation of a ritual lasts 4 days and the Nyopas, the spiritual guides of the community, are responsible for the observance of the ancestral traditions. Even if the lifestyle in Skagam seems stuck in the past, the emergence of cell phones and the internet is raising news hopes. Indeed, Likden dreams of opening a computer school. His brother and friends are studying in Northern India but all want to come back to build a better future for all. Through this Himalayan wedding ceremony, this film is a colorful illustration of the eternal confrontation between tradition and modernity.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20210715/1540227902-Tribes-of-the-himalayas</w></i><x></x></a>
