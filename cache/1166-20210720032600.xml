In the company of his quartet and many special guests, Herman delivers a unique kind of jazz, infused with classical music, pop, and electro. The quartet is energetic, yet focused: Herman and the soprano sax wizard Émile Parisien start in unison the angular melodies with oriental accents of &quot;La confusion sexuelle des papillons&quot;. At more introspective moments, including a nod to his Israeli roots in the sombre &quot;Hatikva&quot;, Herman carefully marks each note, making his instrument sing. The solos of bassist Florent Nisse and drummer Ziv Ravitz bear witness to a rhythmic section as committed and imaginative as Herman might have wished; the eyes of the public will often be riveted on Ravitz's fluid movements and cool-cat grin.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210720/1540216473-Yaron-herman-guests-alter-ego-s</w></i><x></x></a>
