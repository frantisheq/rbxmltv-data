It is produced by the Moscow Philharmonic Society, which Saint Petersburg-born composer Dmitri Shostakovich himself once described as playing a significant role &quot;in the development of musical life [in Russia]. It is a kind of university which is attended by millions of music lovers and thousands of musicians.&quot; The Moscow Philharmonic Society was founded in 1922 by then-Commissar for Culture, Anatoly Lunacharsky, and has over the years come to be Russia's leading concert organizing institution.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210715/1540136683-Rimsky-korsakov-tale-of-the-invisible-city-suite</w></i><x></x></a>
