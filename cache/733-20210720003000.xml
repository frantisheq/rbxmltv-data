The objective of the Conch Farm is to save and protect from extinction the Strombus gigas, the most famous pink sea-shell in the Caribbean, the Queen Conch. The entire process of the life of this sea-shell is very interesting, from birth to its adult state, which we discover both in and out of the water. This sea-shell is only one of the bio-wonders of this archipelago: We discover more wonders on North Caicos in the company of the most famous naturalist of the island. With him we discover the world’s smallest Boa, a reptile native to this island, and also the land caves that were once filled by the sea.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20210720/1540228060-Around-the-world-in-80-islands</w></i><x></x></a>
