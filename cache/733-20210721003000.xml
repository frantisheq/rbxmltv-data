We land on Gran Roque - the only small village big enough to welcome tourists to stay in the typical posadas, there are no roads, cars or chaos - we take our boat and leave for Francisquě Island, where Francesca has an appointment for her first windsurf lesson, a sport that is very popular in this windy archipelago. When her lesson is over we visit the paradise island of Craquě, where only a few fishermen live, some birds and a small family restaurant that prepare wonderful fish dishes for the tourists that arrive there.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20210721/1540228095-Around-the-world-in-80-islands</w></i><x></x></a>
