This festive cantata was composed for Christmas in 1722. Graupner was a very prolific composer, with one of the largest oeuvres in the classical music history. He befriended composers like HÃ¤ndel and Matheson and even was chosen over Johann Sebastian Bach as the new cantor of the St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, but his employer Ernst Ludwig I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen decided otherwise and still wished to keep Graupner as court composer.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210716/1540146827-Graupner-magnificat-anima-mea</w></i><x></x></a>
