Režie: Katharina Muckstein.</k><d>Summertime. Everybody is excited to go on vacation to Italy. Everybody but Jasmin. Jasmin is yearning something. She wants to be with Eva, her mother, from whom she had to live seperately for a long time. For weeks, Jasmin is trying to get close to Eva. She does not give up, even if she's rejected. After an argument, Jasmin runs away from her fosterhome and convinces Eva to leave the city together and go on a trip. The two get closer -- sometimes as friends, sometimes as mother and daughter. A first joint cigarette, a dance in the village disco, wanderings through the woods. But expectations and needs of the girl and her mother are diverging repeatedly, especially when a man attracts Eva's attention and disturbs the growing closeness between mother and daughter.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/filmbox-arthouse/20210717/1540226276-Talea</w></i><x></x></a>
