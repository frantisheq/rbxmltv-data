Performed by Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden.</k><d>Jean Paul's novel 'Titan', in which an artistically gifted young man, driven by his failure to find his way in society, eventually commits suicide in despair, inspired Gustav Mahler to compose his Symphony No. 1. The work did not come easily to Mahler: he composed it between 1887 and 1888 when he, in his twenties, was working as a conductor at the Oper Leipzig. The first version of the work was considered as a symphonic poem in two parts, as its titles told a specific musical story. This original version premiered in Budapest in 1898, but it did not go down well. Mahler decided to revise his work: he left out the expressionist titles and cut the second part (Blumine). This results in a wonderful symphony, full of musical references. The opening part quotes one of Mahler's earlier compositions (Ging heut' morgens übers Feld from Lieder eines Fahrenden Gesellen), the second movement is an Austrian ländler (a folk dance), and the third part refers to a very well-known melody: 'Brother John'. All in all, this Symphony No. 1 marks an incredible achievement for a composer this young.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200603/1410021728-Mahler-symphony-no-1</w></i><x></x></a>
