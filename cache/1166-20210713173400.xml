A wide variety of visiting international jazz musicians share their art of making jazz music with us in the DJAZZ series 'Belgium Sessions'. In these sessions, some of Europe's finest musicians perform their own, original music. New York is Jazz Heaven: small wonder that many young Belgian musicians cross the ocean to try their musical luck in the 'Big Apple'. One of these journeymen brings the fruits of his successful New York experiences to this MotorMusic Session: tenor saxophone player Steven Delannoye and his New York Trio join forces with saxophonist Frank Vaganée. The intense and intriguing dialogue between the two saxophones recalls the golden jazz age of the 1950s, but adds a freshness of approach that is defined by their respective experiences. The horns are underpinned by the powerful NYC-based rhythm section of drummer Jesse Simpson and bassist Desmond White, who contribute a vibrant energy that propels the saxophonists to lofty heights.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210713/1540103783-Motormusic-jazz-sessions-steven-delannoye</w></i><x></x></a>
