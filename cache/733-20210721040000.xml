Join intrepid gastronomer Charlie Ottley as he uncovers the true spirit of Greece. From the secretive monasteries of mount Athos to the snowy pistes of Parnassos, Charlie takes us to the very heart of Greek culture as he embarks on an odyssey of fun, food and adventure. We start our journey in Crete, home to Europe’s oldest civilisation the Minoans. In this action packed episode Charlie discovers a great way to cook lamb in Greece’s first eco-lodge and walks in the footsteps of Daedalus and the Minotaur. We also visit a desert island peppered with Roman Ruins, take a trek up one of Crete’s many stunning coastal gorges and drop in on one of the best new wineries in the country.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20210721/1540228099-Flavours-of-greece</w></i><x></x></a>
