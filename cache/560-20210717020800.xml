Baiba Skride features as soloist in Alban Berg's Violin Concerto. In the slow finale the solo violin's line is gradually joined by the rest of the first violin, providing a lovely moment between soloist and orchestra. Skride's encore is Imitatione delle Campane by von Westhoff, a Bach contemporary. The concert closes with a rendition of Mendelssohn Symphony No. 3, Op. 56, known as the 'Scottish' which actually premiered in the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1842. Recorded on February 22/23, 2018 in the Gewandhaus, Leipzig.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210717/1540155416-Nelsons-conducts-berg-and-mendelssohn</w></i><x></x></a>
