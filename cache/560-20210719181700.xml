On the program are Luciano Berio's Sinfonia for eight voices and orchestra and Antonín Dvořák's Symphony No. 7 in D Minor, Op. 70. When Bychkov selected the program for his first subscription concert as chief conductor of the Czech Philharmonic, he suggested Dvořák's Symphony No. 7 without hesitation, thus honoring the orchestra's national tradition from the very start of his tenure at the helm of the Czech Philharmonic. His choice for Berio's Sinfonia presents a striking contrast: this major, ground-breaking work in twentieth-century music had not been performed in the Czech Republic for 20 years.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210719/1540193755-Berio-s-sinfonia-dvorak-s-symphony-no-7-op-70</w></i><x></x></a>
