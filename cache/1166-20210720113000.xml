The tombak is a Persian percussion instrument, but its rhythms are universal. The Trio Chemirani's music is accessible to all and will certainly resound with each listener. The members of the trio, Djamchid Chemirani (born in Teheran in 1942) and his two sons and pupils Keyvan and Bijan, are living in France. Their concert performances bring them all over the world, as they explore the endless potential of their Persian percussion instruments. The trio finds also inspiration in Mediterranean modal music and jazz. These three musicians, who might well be thought of as poets, are in search of a common language that connects several cultures.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210720/1540216479-Trio-chemirani-daw-r</w></i><x></x></a>
