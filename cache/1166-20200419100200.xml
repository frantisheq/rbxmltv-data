Here they are at the Sydney Entertainment Centre.</k><d>When Daryl Hall and John Oates took to the stage at Sydney's Entertainment Centre as the iconic bass line of 'Maneater' began to play, the fans knew they were in for a treat. This duo may have been opening concerts with that irresistibly smooth number for years, but it never seems to lose its magic, and the crowd – an eclectic mix of teens and baby boomers alike – lapped it up. Daryl Hall and John Oates wisely reunited a few years ago after a string of solo projects, and although Oates no longer sports his signature 'tache, they put on the kind of show that makes it hard to believe they even considered going their separate ways. Earworms like 'I Can't Go For That', 'Out Of Touch' and 'Kiss On My List' were surefire reminders that these guys are absolute hit machines, and their catchy synth-soul classics probably deserve to permeate the airwaves as much today as they did decades ago. These Philly crooners still have it in bucket-loads, so this show should have everyone from diehard Daryl Hall and John Oates fans to kids of the 80's groovin' along in no time.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200419/1390186265-Live-at-the-sydney-entertainment-centre</w></i><x></x></a>
