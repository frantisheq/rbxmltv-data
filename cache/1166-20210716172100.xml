But the members have remained the same, with Ivan Peroti (vocals), Sven Figee (hammond/keys), Tim Eijmaal (guitar), Glenn Gaddum Jr. (bass) and Joost Kroon (drums). Sven Hammond creates greasy funk and soul, featuring hammond grooves, pop and jazz. This steaming music and show machine is headed by Sven Figee, who prefers to attack rather than play his Hammond organ. This time they celebrate their &quot;10-Year Party&quot;, and a funky show is guaranteed!</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210716/1540152270-Sven-hammond-10th-year-anniversary-concert</w></i><x></x></a>
