The concert is Rattle's last time as chief conductor of the orchestra. On 14 November 1987, it was also the first work Rattle conducted when he debuted with the Berlin Philharmonic.</k><d>On November 14, 1987, a promising conductor made his Berlin Philharmonic debut with Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 6: Simon Rattle. In retrospect Rattle says, &quot;I felt that I was finding my voice on that day.&quot; Mahler's multifaceted work is now again on the program when Sir Simon appears for the last time as chief conductor of the Berliner Philharmoniker in the Philharmonie in 2018. The wheel comes full circle. Mahler's Symphony No. 6 is often referred to by the nickname Tragische (&quot;Tragic&quot;). Mahler composed work during a happy time in his life, as he had married his wife Alma in 1902 and became father of his second daughter. This contrasts with the tragic and even nihilistic last movement of the symphony.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210715/1540136679-Mahler-symphony-no-6</w></i><x></x></a>
