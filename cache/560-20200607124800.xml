If Italy is the wellspring of music, the city of Bologna is its ultimate source. The illustrious Bologna conservatory has educated the world's greatest composers and musicians. Although Mozart was too young to study at the conservatory, he still took the entrance examination to prove his talent. In this episode, Malcolm Frager performs Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 5, KV 175, a work of contrapuntal writing, a style that Mozart perfected under Padre Martini's tutelage. Discover the Orchestra della Radiotelevisione della Svizzera and conducted by Marc Andreae, at the Teatro Bibiena in Mantua.</d></p><i><t>Seriál</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200607/1410027881-Mozart-on-tour-episode-3-milan-and-bologna</w></i><x></x></a>
