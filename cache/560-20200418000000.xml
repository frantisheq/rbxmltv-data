As the result of the collaboration between Verdi and the Neapolitan librettist Salvatore Cammarano, Luisa Miller is based on a play written by Friedrich Schiller titled Intrigue and Love. The work was composed in 1849 for the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. It marks a turning point in Verdi's production and life, since the composer had moved back to Busseto, his birthplace, while writing it. As a consequence, Verdi distanced himself from patriotic heroism, a typical characteristic found in his early operas. This becomes obvious in his work: the action of Luisa Miller is not part of great historical events, but revolves around love affairs in a simple Tyrolean village. This interpretation was recorded 2014 at the Opéra Royal de Wallonie, Liege and stars Patrizia Ciofi, Gregory Kunde, Nicola Alaimo, Bálint Szabó, Luciano Montanaro, Alexise Yerna, Cristina Melis and Stefano De Rosa.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200418/1390165431-Verdi-luisa-miller</w></i><x></x></a>
