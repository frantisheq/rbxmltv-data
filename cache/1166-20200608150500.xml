After his show in Istanbul, he felt greatly attracted to the Turkish sound from the 1970s. With band members Ben Rider (guitar) and Nic Mauskovic (drums), he went looking for other Turkish musicians to join the band. Soon after, Merve Dasdemir (vocals) and Erdinc Yildiz Ecevit (vocals, saxophone, keys) joined the group. With the energetic Jungle by Night percussionist, Gino Groeneveld, the band was complete. During their 2018 show at BIRD Rotterdam, Altin Gün released their new album &quot;On.&quot; Enjoy a new interpretation of Turkish traditional music, with a unique blend of Turkish folk, psychedelics, funk and rock. The show guarantees to make you dance around the campfire!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200608/1410039636-Altin-g-n-bird-rotterdam</w></i><x></x></a>
