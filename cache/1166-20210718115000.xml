Assisted by producer Cheick Tidiane Seck, Dee Dee sets out to discover the 'traditional' music of the country, and to collaborate with singers, drummers, ngoni and kora players. She meets and records with celebrated artists, such as 'jelimusow' (female griot) Tata Bambo and world-famous 'wassoulou' singer Oumou Sangaré. The documentary showcases the particular popularity and strength of female Malian artists who, since the growth of cassette-based music culture in the 1980s, have come to dominate the music scene.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210718/1540177931-Dee-dee-bridgewater-red-earth</w></i><x></x></a>
