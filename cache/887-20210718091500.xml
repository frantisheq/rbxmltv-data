The brilliant hue of the surrounding waters is called &quot;Shakotan Blue,&quot; while its sheer cliffs create an impressive landscape. The program host takes a clear-bottomed kayak out into the sea with a local guide to take in the scenery from the water. They row their kayaks into a cave in the cliff, where the water glows a mysterious blue color.
