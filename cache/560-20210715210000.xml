The work of celebrated Taiwanese dancer and choreographer Lin Hwai-min draws inspiration from a Buddhist proverb: &quot;Flowers in a mirror and moon on the water are both illusive&quot; and the ideal state of mind of Tai Chi practitioners: &quot;Energy flows as water, while the spirit shines as the moon.&quot; The choreographer merges the art of dance and Tai Chi and bases his creative work on these famous quotes to create a poetic translation of Taoist philosophy. Moon Water compares opposites: real versus unreal, effort versus effortlessness and the concept of yin and yang. In a beautiful set created by Austin Wang, the performers of the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan create an enchanting scenery to the melodies of nine suites of Bach's Suites for Solo Cello.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210715/1540136685-Moon-water</w></i><x></x></a>
