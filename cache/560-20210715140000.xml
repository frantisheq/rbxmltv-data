Among the soloists are Olivier Laquerre, Stephanie Novacek, Monica Whicher, Marie Lenormand, Alain Coulombe, and Curtis Sullivan. Composed by Jean Baptiste Lully for Louis XIV, Persée is widely recognized as Lully's greatest creation and was considered the crowning achievement of 17th century French music theatre. Filled with dancing, fight scenes, monsters and special effects, this truly spectacular opera recounts the thrilling story of Perseus, son of Zeus and heroic vanquisher of the snake-haired Gorgon Medusa.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210715/1540136678-Lully-persee</w></i><x></x></a>
