Hosted annually in Bremen, Germany, it brings together musicians, bookers, agents, organizers, jazz experts, and music enthusiasts. In 2019, jazzahead! pays special attention to Norway by selecting 40 jazz acts from all over the world and inviting them to perform over the course of three days. One of them is Naissam Jalal's trio. Jalal brings together pianist Leonardo Montana and double bassist Claude Tchamitchian. The band's repertoire is at the crossroads of traditional mystical music and modal jazz. In their project &quot;Quest of the Invisible,&quot; silence plays a central role. The rhythm always leads towards trance in a repetitive and hypnotic form. Their creation oscillates between contemplation and trance, silence and music.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200606/1410026410-Naissam-jalal-quest-of-the-invisible-jazzahead</w></i><x></x></a>
