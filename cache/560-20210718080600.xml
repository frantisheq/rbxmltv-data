This trio was among the last compositions completed by Schubert and is dated November 1827. It was published late 1828, shortly before Schubert's death and first performed in January 1828 to celebrate the engagement of Schubert's friend Josef von Spaun. The second theme of the opening movement is based on a theme from the Trio of Schubert's Piano Sonata No. 18 (D. 894). The main theme of the second movement is used as a central musical theme in Kubrick's film Barry Lyndon (1975).</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210718/1540170869-Schubert-piano-trio-no-2-op-100-d-929</w></i><x></x></a>
