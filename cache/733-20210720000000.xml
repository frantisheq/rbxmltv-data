As we sail we visit the fjords of the Beagle channel along side the glaciers of the Cordillera Darwin. To cross Glacier Avenue is an unforgettable experience; icy winds and high seas accompany us as we sail toward the legendary Cape Horn, a destination that all fearless sailors want to see, as they follow the route set by Sir Francis Drake so as to pit their wits and challenge these waters to try to &quot;round the Horn&quot;. As we pass to observe the wild nature in the Magellan forest of Baia Wulaia, our expedition comes to an end at Ushuaia, the southernmost city of the planet and it is for this reason it is called the city at the end of the world.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20210720/1540228059-Around-the-world-in-80-islands</w></i><x></x></a>
