It portrays extraordinary composers who were active in the cultural city of Vienna and deserve the label of genius. In Man About Town (Part 3) we follow the life and work of Franz Schubert, born in Vienna in 1797. For a composer of such joyful melody there is a sad side to his story. The evenings of dancing, music and banter may have been called Schubertiades, but the man himself was only ever a guest. He was not the darling of society as he's sometimes portrayed. He lived and loved amongst a tight circle of mostly male friends who adored him and, as much as they could, protected him. But alas, they were not enough. In his mid-twenties he was stricken by disease and didn't live to see his 32nd birthday. Schubert was a man of grace and charm, a man of limitless energy and creativity, yet his life ended before he could pay proper tribute to his greatest hero, Beethoven.</d></p><i><t>Seri√°l</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210720/1540208910-Sons-of-vienna-part-3-man-about-town</w></i><x></x></a>
