Their quest takes them all over the world, to destinations that include France, Reunion Island, Morocco, Turkey, Quebec, India, Namibia, Spain, Mexico, Ireland and Chile. The wind carves out the landscape of a country and shapes its inhabitants, customs and culture. These incisive, entertaining mini-road movies document our travellers' encounters with local people - moving, instructive, sometimes bizarre and always exotic. Wherever the wind blows, Arthur tries out wind-related activities, while Antoine seeks out elusive air currents, with his kite, hang-glider and slackline always at the ready.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20210720/1540228090-Windquest</w></i><x></x></a>
