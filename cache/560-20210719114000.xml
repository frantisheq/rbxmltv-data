Echoes of San Marco opens with a quote from Gabrieli's &quot;Canzon Septimi Toni&quot; from the &quot;Sacre Sinfoniae&quot;, and is just like the original work composed for two choirs of brass instruments. &quot;Fellini&quot; is composed for solo saxophone and orchestra and is a tribute to Italian film director Federico Fellini (1920-1993). De Meij composed the work for saxophone player Hans de Jong, who during this concert is dressed as a melancholic clown to intensify the dreamy and imaginary worlds present in Fellini's films. This concert is recorded at the Sala dei Teatini of the Teatri di Piacenza in 2018. Directed by Pietro Tagliaferri.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210719/1540193747-Johan-de-meij-echoes-of-san-marco-fellini</w></i><x></x></a>
