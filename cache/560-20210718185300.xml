Presumably, he wrote these sonatas for Prince Leopold and later adapted them for further use in Leipzig. Maybe this is why these pieces are well playable for amateurs, while every sonata still has the finesse that can offer a challenge to professional musicians. The different pieces are meant to be a set, just like the Brandenburg concertos.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210718/1540170878-Bach-sonata-no-2-bwv-1015</w></i><x></x></a>
