Its name BIRD refers to the nickname of legendary New York jazz saxophonist, bebop co-founder Charlie Parker. BIRD serves Neapolitan pizzas, fine wines, no-nonsense beers, and an all-round metropolitan rawness. Since 2014, this urban jazz club and DJAZZ.tv have been collaborating for a series of music programs: BIRD.tv, allowing you to experience the best BIRD concerts and interviews as from a first-row seat! This episode is dedicated to seven brothers from the south side of Chicago: The Hypnotic Brass Ensemble AKA Bad Boys of Jazz, Tha Bros, and Yo Favorite Band! The band freely adds generous doses of hip-hop, soul, and funk to the brass band tradition, creating an intoxicating and boisterous blend: perfect for another episode of BIRD.tv!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200607/1410030663-Birdtv-hypnotic-brass-ensemble</w></i><x></x></a>
