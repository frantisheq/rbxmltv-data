<a><n>Al Di Meola: One of These Nights</n><s o="2020-05-23 04:13:00" d="2020-05-23 05:45:00" n="DJazz" id_tv="1166"></s><p><d>&quot;One Of These Nights&quot; was a very special event for Al Di Meola - a night like his legendary &quot;Friday Night In San Francisco&quot;, recorded almost a quarter of a century ago. Al Di Meola assembled a thoroughly excellent group of musicians for this review of the highlights of a career spanning almost three decades - a fantastic combination of romantic chamber music, traditional Latin American music and free jazz, constantly switching between off-the-cuff improvisation and intricate set-pieces. Time and again the musicians manage to vary familiar pieces with surprising rhythm changes and brilliant soundscapes. Pianist Mario Parmisano and the two master drummers Ernie Adams and Gumbi Ortiz are always congenial partners, and Hungary's Sturcz String Quartet give the music an unusual flavor. Masterful solos, riveting, sometimes humorous dialogs and fascinating group playing round off this live recording, a stroll through Al Di Meola's rich repertoire of classics in a new, attractive sound. A truly magical concert.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200523/1400280596-Al-di-meola-one-of-these-nights</w></i><x></x></a>
