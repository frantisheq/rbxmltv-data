This concert offers a journey into the French romantic repertoire performed by pianist David Violi (piano), Jodie Devos (soprano) and Anaik Morel (mezzo-soprano). The program contains some of the most beloved French arias, such as 'Seguedille' from Bizet's Carmen by Bizet, the Flower Duet from Delibes' Lakmé and 'Mon coeur s'ouvre a ta voix' from Saint-Saëns Samson et Dalila. Recorded at the Palazzetoo Bru Zane in Venice, Italy in 2016.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210715/1540136669-Tribute-to-french-romanticism-at-venice</w></i><x></x></a>
