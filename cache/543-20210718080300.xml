Later in the year it was released across Europe to universal acclaim and huge commercial success. Her second album “The Shocking Miss Emerald”, released in the spring of 2013, was a No.1 album in the UK and Holland and continues to be a top chart title in many territories. This performance was filmed at the BBC Radio Theatre for BBC’s “In Concert” series in 2013. The show features a mix of tracks from both her studio albums, including all her hits, and with a cover version of the Noel Coward song “Mad About The Boy”. Caro Emerald is a wonderful live performer with a fantastic voice and an engaging personality and this concert captures her at her best.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20210718/1540297617-Caro-emerald-caro-emerald-in-concert</w></i><x></x></a>
