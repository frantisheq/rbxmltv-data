Handel's two-part oratorio &quot;Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno&quot; (The Triumph of Time and Truth). The work with a libretto by Benedetto Pamphili was first performed in Rome, in 1707. Director Krzysztof Warlikowski has taken Handel's first oratorio, written when the composer was only 22 years old, on in a deep, tender staging. In this oratorio, the characters Time and Disillusion try to convince Beauty to abandon Pleasure for less fleeting gratifications. Sabine Devieilhe is unquestionably the star that carries the show, always impressive in technique, range and timbre. Her sparring and harmonizing with Franco Fagioli is magnificent. Other soloists are Michael Spyres and Sara Mingardo. Recorded at the Festival d'Aix-en-Provence in 2016.</d></p><i><t>Zábava</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210719/1540193757-Handel-the-triumph-of-time-and-truth</w></i><x></x></a>
