Faced with this repeated “anger of the gods”, a Ladakhi writer-director shares with us his concerns and the troubles of his people. He talks about the spiritual relationship between the Ladahki people and nature. We follow him during his daily life, his encounters with fellow Ladahkis and through impressive Buddhist ceremonies. By discovering their lives we get closer to these people looking to the future and towards hope.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20210717/1540227972-Jungwa-the-broken-balance</w></i><x></x></a>
