Different from the cold viewpoint of the camera that follows the serene everyday life of the main characters, the view in the camera lens is like an episode of a drama.&quot;Screening Humanity&quot; is the view through a microscope. The lens captures the everyday life of our surroundings and presents the people's story.</d></p><i><t>Dokument</t><qq><q id="r">repr√≠za</q></qq><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/kbs-world/20210718/1541054556-Screening-humanity-4463</w></i><x></x></a>
