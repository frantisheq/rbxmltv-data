1990. New York Jazz Quartet. Monteleone Hotel, New Orleans, U.S.A.</k><d>One of those groups whose name does not reflect the legendary players in it is the New York Jazz Quartet: founded by pianist Roland Hanna in the early 1970s to appeal to the Japanese jazz market, the Quartet has over the years consisted of artists such as Ron Carter, Grady Tate, and Hubert Laws – but tonight's quintet incarnation of the group might even surpass those names. Hanna is joined by super bassist George Mraz, &quot;Sir&quot; Roland Hanna, and drummer Marvin Smith, and two Basie-ites named Frank: Frank Wess, and, as special guest, his more robust-toned namesake, Frank Foster. These veterans of the Count Basie Band are featured in a superbly swinging set of straight-ahead jazz originals. This broadcast from Duke's Place offers the first part of the performance.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190821/1310335972-New-york-jazz-quartet-jazz-at-duke-s</w></i><x></x></a>
