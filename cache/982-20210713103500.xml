The album releases that have crossed Ethiopian borders are mainly recordings from the 50's to the 80's, however, the contemporary music scene from Addis remains, bar a few exceptions, unknown to the rest of the world. Is Addis still swinging as it used to? Music in Addis is present in actions and sounds spread out on differentiated spaces, it is an expression of the everyday urban life and its processes of transformation and adaptation in the city. New Voices In An Old Flower explores this vitality of music looking at the plurality of the city and its people. Drifting in unplanned tours through the urban landscape of contemporary Addis Ababa, this film is shaped by encounters, dialogues and collaborations with musicians and other inhabitants of the city.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/filmbox-arthouse/20210713/1540226201-New-voices-in-an-old-flower</w></i><x></x></a>
