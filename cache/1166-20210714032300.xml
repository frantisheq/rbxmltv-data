He travels the world with his jazz bands, plays guitar and bouzouki, writes jazz and theatre-songs, and co-creates and directs the exuberant theatre shows of his wife, the Dutch diva Karin Bloemen. Busstra is a constant wheel of invention, with technique expanded by his creative urge to find something new, an evolving state that adds immeasurably to his art. The Marnix Busstra Band was founded in 2011 by its namesake. Joined by piano talent Rembrandt Frerichs, the ever creative double bassist Arnold Dooyeweerd and the inspirational force of drummer Pieter Bast, Busstra introduces a unique band that will definitely help broaden the jazz horizon. Marnix' compositions are the starting point of the band. Musically, this band is a continuation of a development started by the quartet that Marnix co-leads with the renowned vibraphonist, Mike Mainieri. The result can best be described as lyrical, multifaceted jazz that centres around the profound interplay of the four musicians.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210714/1540125548-North-sea-jazz-club-marnix-busstra-band</w></i><x></x></a>
