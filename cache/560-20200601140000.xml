Despite this great symbolism, the objectives and ambitions of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra are first and foremost musical: the political divisions of the Middle East are setting aside the time of the union of these young musical talents which speaks volumes about the power of cultural interaction. This performance delivered to Victoria Hall in Geneva features two famous masterpieces: Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3 and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5. The concert ends with the Sad Waltz of Sibelius and the opening of La Forza del Destino of Verdi.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200601/1410020635-Concert-live-from-geneva</w></i><x></x></a>
