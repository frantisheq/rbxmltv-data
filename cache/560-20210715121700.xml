Considering that Johannes Brahms had toiled for more than 15 years on his First Symphony, it is hardly surprising that his Second Symphony should be a lighter, brighter work that makes masterful use of the achievements from the First. Expansive and unhurried, it charms the ear with its lyricism and excites it with its passionate tutti outbursts. It has been a favorite among Brahms' orchestral works since its premiere in late 1876. Welser-Möst leads his &quot;devoted and exemplarily precise musicians&quot; (Die Presse) in a rendition that polishes every detail to make the work glow from within. Thanks to his many years at the head of the Cleveland Orchestra, Welser-Möst can mold the most intricate sonorities with the subtlest of means. This performance was recorded at the Musikverein, Vienna, Austria, in 2014.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210715/1540136674-Brahms-symphony-no-2-op-73</w></i><x></x></a>
