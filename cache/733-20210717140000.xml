Upon their arrival, they purchased virgin lands from the Indians where they started a settlement, never imagining that one day it would become the most famous city in the world: New York.

It corrects the historical misconception still recorded in our school books, which has it that Peter Stuyvesant is the cityâ€™s founder.
