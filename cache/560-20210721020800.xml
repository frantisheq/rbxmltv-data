Soloist is clarinettist Andreas Ottensamer with his interpretation of Carl Maria von Weber's highly elaborate Clarinet Concerto. The first part of the program continues with Antonín Dvořák's unusually optimistic and light-hearted Symphony No. 8, before the concert concludes with Johannes Brahms' Hungarian Dance No. 5. The Berliner Philharmoniker is conducted by Mariss Jansons, who was a close associate of the orchestra for decades.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210721/1540230439-Europakonzert-2017-from-paphos</w></i><x></x></a>
