Renowned soloists, under the baton of Sir John Elliot Gardiner, perform this magic piece at the Chapelle Royale de Versailles, in France.</k><d>In 1610, Monteverdi gave his Vespers for the Virgin in Mantova, before conquering Saint-Mark's Basilica in Venice. It is the first great religious masterpiece of baroque. It has remained one of the key works in the universal musical heritage. After the genius of Orfeo (1607), the Vespers use its opening fanfare again and confirm Monteverdi as the main composer of his time. Sir John Elliot Gardiner conducted this work for the first time in 1964 and recorded it twice. It is for this work that he founded the Monteverdi Choir, one of the best choirs in the world. For their 50th anniversary in 2014, they perform Monteverdi's masterpiece Vespro della Beata Vergine at the Chapelle Royale de Versailles in France. The Monteverdi choir performs this masterpiece with the English Baroque Soloists and Les Pages du Centre de musique baroque de Versailles. The soloists are Silvia Frigato, Emanuela Galli, Raffaele Pe, Krystian Adam, Nicholas Mulroy, Gareth Treseder, Alexander Ashworth, and Robert Davies.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210720/1540208913-Monteverdi-vespro-della-beata-vergine</w></i><x></x></a>
