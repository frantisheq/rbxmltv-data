On the program are three of his most beloved works for orchestra. The concert opens with Prélude a l'apres-midi d'un faune, a symphonic poem based on the eponymous poem by Stéphane Mallarmé. It is one of the composer's most famous works and considered a turning point in the history of music. The program continues with music from Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande in an orchestral arrangement by Marius Constant. The concert closes with a rendition La Mer, a work composed of the three symphonic sketches.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210715/1540136664-Tribute-to-debussy</w></i><x></x></a>
