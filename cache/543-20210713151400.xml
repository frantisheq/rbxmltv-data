The festival’s lineup invariably includes a wide range of artists from a variety of music genres. One of the acts of the festival's 2016 edition was Charles Bradley &amp; His Extraordinaires. For decades Bradley made a living singing the music of James Brown, until he was discovered by Daptone Records, which eventually released Bradley’s four albums. Rooting his music in funk, soul and R&amp;B, Bradley is hailed for shaping the sound of the record label that first acknowledged his individuality. His 2016 performance at ‘Musiques en Stock’ is on the way to become a classic that epitomizes everything Bradley represents: it is full of raw energy, urban Afro-American culture, and classic 1960s vibes.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20210713/1540174035-Charles-bradley-charles-bradley-musiques-en-stock-2016</w></i><x></x></a>
