We listen to the ancient history of these islands, following the remains of the ancient cotton plantations, we also explore the sea beds which are full of marine life. The sea in the Caribbean archipelago allows travellers to scuba dive, sail and kayak. And it is with a kayak that we enter the mangrove forest of Little Water Key, the elected habitat of native iguanas. In the natural reserve you can find about 2000 examples of Cyclura carinata carinata, a species here known as the Turk &amp; Caicos ground iguana brought here by man to save it from extinction.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200422/1390342200-Around-the-world-in-80-islands-full-immersion-in-the-sea</w></i><x></x></a>
