It was an emotional night and would be their last gig for 5 years. The band played a set containing all their best loved hits from across their career and were joined by founder member Tom Johnston for the last two tracks, with former members John Hartman (also from the original line-up), Tiran Porter and Michael Hossack coming on stage for the celebratory finale of “Listen To The Music”. The band are in fantastic form and rise to the occasion magnificently, they can rarely have delivered a better performance throughout their distinguished career.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20210719/1540332861-The-doobie-brothers-live-at-the-greek-theater</w></i><x></x></a>
