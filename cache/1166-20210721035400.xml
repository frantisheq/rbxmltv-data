The West Coast Jazz movement had its origins about 50 years ago in Los Angeles. It was essentially a &quot;cool&quot; form of jazz played mostly by studio musicians as a break from their studio work. The West Coast All Stars are specially brought together for this West Coast Night. The performance shows some of the most important early pioneers of this style of jazz - including legends such as Conte Candoli, Carl Fontana and Teddy Edwards. Jazz writer and critic Alun Morgan about this concert: &quot;Altogether a very impressive experience. These guys are all real jazz pros who can turn in a masterly performance at the drop of a hat. Who said West Coast Jazz was cold and sterile? These guys can churn up enough excitement to bring any audience to its feet.&quot;</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210721/1540241253-Jazz-open-stuttgart-west-coast-all-stars</w></i><x></x></a>
