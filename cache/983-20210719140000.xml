What seemed to be the limit has been exceeded multiple times and high-end technology has driven the adrenaline seekers to unique sports... like hydro flight! Gold Coast, Australia and the InterContinental Sanctuary Cove Resort hosted the first event of the 2018 Poseidon Games. With the great efforts of Savvy Entertainment and Jet Pack Events, fans of the hydro flight community witnessed two days of exciting performances as the industry took a huge leap in technical progression. The World's top riders will be competing, flying on their hydro flight devices, for 3 more intense events. After Australia, the tour will make its way to Singapore and New York, before its conclusion in Bermuda.</d></p><i><t>Sport</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/fast-funbox-hd/20210719/1540223608-Poseidon-games</w></i><x></x></a>
