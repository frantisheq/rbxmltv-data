Artists such as Charlie Parker, Leonard Bernstein, Steve Reich and Philip Glass have called him one of the great musical visionaries of our century. Day in and day out, the man whose real name is Louis T. Hardin, was as taciturn and unchanging a landmark of the midtown Manhattan streetscape as the George M. Cohan statue in Duffy Square. No matter the weather, he invariably dressed in a homemade robe, sandals, a flowing cape, and a horned Viking helmet - the tangible expression of what he referred to as his &quot;Nordic philosophy&quot;. For this show, he teams up with renowned saxophone ensemble London Saxophonic for an eccentric performance.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200607/1410030655-Moondog-the-london-saxophonique</w></i><x></x></a>
