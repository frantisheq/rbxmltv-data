András Schiff's versatile artistry excels both as pianist and conductor, as this program illustrates. He is joined by Vilde Frang, a superlative Mozart interpreter, and master violist Tabea Zimmermann for Mozart's Sinfonia concertante. The work exemplifies the vast range of emotion Mozart is capable of instilling in one single work: from serene and joyful in the outer movements, to thoughtful and sad in the central movement. Schumann and Brahms - Schiff accompanies Tabea Zimmermann in the core 19th century viola repertoire. Unlike Schumann, whose Märchenbilder were written with the viola in mind, Brahms' wrote his Op.120 for clarinet and piano. He soon provided a viola transcription, which has become as popular than the original.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210720/1540208915-Mozart-sinfonia-concertante-k-364</w></i><x></x></a>
