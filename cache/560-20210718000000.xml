Yannick Nézet-Séguin conducts the Metropolitan Opera in this performance of Francis Poulenc's gripping opera, based on the play by Georges Bernano. It tells the story of a community of Carmelite nuns during the French Revolution who decides to face death at the guillotine rather than renounce their vows. Poulenc was an urbane Parisian with a profound mystical dimension, and the opera addresses both the characters' private lives and their external realities—it is in equal measure historical, psychological, and spiritual. Featuring Isabel Leonard (mezzo), Karen Cargill (soprano), and Erin Morley (soprano). This performance was recorded at the Metropolitan Opera Hall in New York City, USA, in 2019.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210718/1540170862-Poulenc-dialogues-des-carmelites</w></i><x></x></a>
