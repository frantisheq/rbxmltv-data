The two team up for an amazing concert in which jazz is combined with soul and a touch of chanson française. The Franco-American pianist Terrasson delights in travelling the world, collaboration with others and leading his own trio, quartet, or quintet. With his long-time friend, Stéphane Belmondo, Terrasson has produced wonderful CDs and beautiful concerts. One then finds the trumpeter on the pianist's album 'Gouache'; on another, the pianist guests on Belmondo's 'Ever After'. At the Jazz en Baie festival, the duo plays its amazing piano and trumpet music. Highly recommended!</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210716/1540152262-Terrasson-belmondo-a-nous-garo</w></i><x></x></a>
