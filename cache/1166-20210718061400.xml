In this series, the Hammond B3 organ takes centre stage. Rob Mostert invites the world's finest jazz musicians for a musical collaboration, in which the Hammond Organ plays a major role. The Hammond B3 is an electric organ, which generates sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup. Initially, the Hammond B3 was at home in churches, until it entered the jazz scene in the mid-20th century. In this episode, Mostert joins forces with the Australian Hammond organ player Lachy Doley and his regular band. Doley is considered one of the best blues, soul and rock organ players, nicknamed &quot;the Jimi Hendrix of the Hammond organ&quot;.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210718/1540177924-The-hammonds-sessions-lachy-doley-group</w></i><x></x></a>
