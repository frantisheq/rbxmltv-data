The opera in three acts is based on the play Její Pastorkyňa by Czech playwright Gabriela Preissová. It tells the story of Jenůfa and her stepmother, the verger's wife, and is set within the confines of a closed community in Moravia, Czech Republic. Within this community, rivalry, jealousy and social control among the involved characters eventually lead to the dramatic murder of an innocent child. Leoš Janáček's third opera, based on the controversial play by Gabriela Preissová, is best known as Jenůfa, but by subtitling it &quot;Her Stepdaughter,&quot; the composer intended to stress the central role of the stepmother. Although Janáček's score was rejected for a long time by the National Theatre in Prague, Jenůfa proved to be his breakthrough as a composer in musical theater, where he used the speech melody as &quot;the most authentic expression of the soul.&quot; The soloists of this marvelous interpretation are Sally Matthews (Jenůfa), Charles Workman (Laca Klemeň), Nicky Spence (Števa Buryja) and many more.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210716/1540146844-Janacek-jenufa</w></i><x></x></a>
