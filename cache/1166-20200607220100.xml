For the last 14 years, he has been producing a blues-rock tinged with soul with his band The Black Tornado. The stability of the lineup of Thorbj?rn Risager &amp; The Black Tornado is a rarity in today's music industry; five of its eight members have been part of the group since 2003. During their career, the band released 11 albums and played over 800 shows. These guys have found the recipe for sustainability: songs cleverly strung and produced.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200607/1410030672-Thjorb-rn-risager-the-black-tornado</w></i><x></x></a>
