He created a new style of jazz and won equal fame as the king of the hipsters before his untimely death at 34. Celebrating Bird includes Parker's only surviving TV appearance, performing Hot House with trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. Celebrating Bird offers a revealing look at an enigmatic, endlessly appealing man, who soared to the heights of creative freedom but couldn't beat a lifelong addiction to heroin. Colleagues Dizzy Gillespie, Roy Haynes, Jay McShann, Frank Morgan, Chan Parker and others offer first-hand commentary.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210714/1540125560-Celebrating-bird</w></i><x></x></a>
