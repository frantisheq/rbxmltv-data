There was never any doubt about what instrument she would play as a child. &quot;It's really the most beautiful instrument in the world,&quot; she once stated in an interview. &quot;The first thing I did was take my shoes off and work the pedals.&quot; This performance at the French Festival Jazz a Vienne is extra special. Not only because of the beautiful location, but also because she shares the stage with American gospel and blues singer La Velle. Together they give an intimate and beautiful show in the antique theatre of Vienne.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210714/1540125553-Rhoda-scott-la-velle-hammond-soul-and-blues</w></i><x></x></a>
