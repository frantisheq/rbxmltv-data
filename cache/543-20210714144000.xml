Although nobody knew at the time, it was to be Ronnie James Dios last filmed concert appearance before his death in May 2010 from stomach cancer. Heaven &amp; Hell were on fantastic form and played a set blending tracks from the newly released album with classics from their Black Sabbath days. This is a truly fitting tribute to one of the legendary voices of rock.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20210714/1540199717-Heaven-and-hell-neon-nights-30-years-of-heaven-and-hell</w></i><x></x></a>
