Featuring over 700 artists from all over the world, the annual festival blends unique expressions of African, Caribbean and Latin American culture. One of the festival's participants is Ramon Chicharron. He was born in Columbia but left his country at the age of 19 to find his musical path. Today he expresses his roots by fusing sounds, rhythms and languages with Afro-Colombian cumbia and champeta beats mixed with salsa. With lyrics inspired by the goddess Pachamama (&quot;Puya Amazonica&quot;) and the situation of immigrants (&quot;El Tren,&quot; &quot;Planeta Flotante&quot;), Ramon Chicharron hopes to share a message of conscience while preserving Afro-Colombian folklore.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210716/1540152257-Ramon-chicharron-destination-nuits-d-afrique</w></i><x></x></a>
