Ferguson and his band turn in a performance that includes some hits of the day, including Weather Report's &quot;Birdland&quot; and Rocky's theme, &quot;Gonna Fly Now.&quot;</k><d>The Brussels Jazz Club was filled to the brim with both musicians and audience members when the Maynard Ferguson Big Band performed there during their Winter Tour of 1980. From the first notes of the cover of Weather Report's &quot;Birdland&quot; that opens the performance to the final notes of &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot; that closes it, Ferguson gives his young sidemen ample time to shine. The mutual admiration shared by the leader and his sidemen makes this performance a delight to watch.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210718/1540177921-Winter-1980-maynard-ferguson-big-band-in-brussels</w></i><x></x></a>
