The only finished and preserved opera by Boito is based on Goethe's Faust and premiered at La Scala, Milan in 1868 under the baton of the composer himself. It was badly received, provoked riots and duels over its supposed Wagnerism and was closed by police after only two performances. Boito made a more successful and drastically cut second version which premiered in Bologna in 1875. Boito combines influences of Verdi and Wagner in his musical work: rousing choirs, intricate melodies accompanied by music that is almost cinematic in intent. The main role in this performance is sung by Erwin Schrott. Other soloists are Charles Castronovo, Angel Joy Blue, Alex Penda, Jana Kurucová, Bror Magnus T?denes, Luciana Mancini and Rudolf Schasching. Recorded in the Festivalhaus Baden-Baden in Austria in 2016 and directed by Philipp Himmelmann.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210718/1540170881-Boito-mefistofele</w></i><x></x></a>
