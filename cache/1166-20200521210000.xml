This steaming soul machine is headed by Sven Figee, who prefers to attack rather than play his Hammond organ. In April 2012, the band was augmented with vocalist Jenny Lane. Today's recordings were made at a steaming live performance at Utrecht's Tivoli in 2012.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200521/1400219698-Sven-hammond-soul-tivoli-de-helling</w></i><x></x></a>
