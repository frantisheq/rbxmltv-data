The orchestra collects the best classical music performers of the world by gathering promising young talents and well-established artists. Among them are Johani Gonzales, a young double bass player from one of Caracas' worst quarters, and the famous German trumpeter Reinhold Friedrich. The documentary follows the orchestra's European tour of 2012-2013, offering a unique glance at Maestro Abbado's work, as well as on the work of today's classical musicians. The film describes, both from a musical and a human point of view, the public and the private life of a group of musicians: Maria Francesca Latella, Federica Vignoni, Lucas Navarro, Alois Posch, Reinhold Friedrich, Alessio Allegrini, and Johane Gonzalez. The documentary includes a long and previously unreleased interview with Maestro Abbado, and concert and rehearsal footage from Bologna, Lucerne, Vienna, Madrid and Palermo.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200608/1410033158-Claudio-abbado-orchestra-mozart</w></i><x></x></a>
