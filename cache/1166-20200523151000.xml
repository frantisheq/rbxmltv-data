Its name 'BIRD' refers to the nickname of the legendary New York jazz saxophonist, bebop co-founder Charlie Parker (1920-1955). BIRD serves Neapolitan pizzas, good wines, no-nonsense beers and an all-round metropolitan rawness. Since 2014, this urban jazz club and DJAZZ.tv have been collaborating for a series of music programmes: 'BIRD.tv', allowing you to experience the best BIRD concerts and interviews as from a first row seat! In this episode, we present the London-based French-Ghanian soul jazz singer Myles Sanko (.1980). Since his youth, the stage has been Myles Sanko's second home: he performed in the clubs and bars of his hometown Cambridge (UK), later becoming part of the British funk band Speedometer. His exceptional voice, his lyrics and his modern, cool style have earned him lots of praise as well as a loyal fan base, that extends far beyond the borders of the United Kingdom!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200523/1400280606-Birdtv-myles-sanko</w></i><x></x></a>
