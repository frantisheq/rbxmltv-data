He was one of the first African musicians to score a worldwide hit with his 1972 release &quot;Soul Makossa&quot;, paving the way for many other artists. The very concept of world music owes much to him. A superb stage performer with great communicative humour, Dibango is above all one of the founding fathers of a modern African musical style that is open to jazz, R&amp;B, salsa, gospel, funk, and reggae. This concert showcases all these genres, and features an excellent line-up of musicians from the four corners of the planet.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210720/1540216486-Soul-makossa-manu-dibango-in-stuttgart</w></i><x></x></a>
