In Vienna, Mozart experienced the highest and lowest points of his life. Traveling in the retinue of his ecclesiastical employer, Archbishop Colloredo of Salzburg, Wolfgang was fired from his job; too proud to follow his father's example and beg for his old position, Wolfgang found himself abandoned, friendless, and destitute. But whom did he run into, but the Webers from Mannheim. Mozart fell madly in love with Constanze, an ingenious young woman who would do anything to win her man's heart. The tumultuous union of Mozart and Constanze is today considered one of the greatest love stories of all time. The performance of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 17, KV 453 was recorded at the Imperial Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna and features soloist Dezsö Ránki and the English Chamber Orchestra, conducted by JeffreyTate.</d></p><i><t>Seriál</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210717/1540155417-Mozart-on-tour-episode-7-vienna-i</w></i><x></x></a>
