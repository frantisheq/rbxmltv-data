On August 16, the young British organist Jeremiah Stephenson performed at the medieval Basilique Saint-Sauveur with the French chamber choir Dulci Jubilo under the direction of its founder, Christopher Gibert. The organ plays a central role in this atmospheric concert, which opens with Trois motets by composer and organist Thierry Escaich (.1965). The three-part suite is made up of Eaux natales, Le Masque, and Vers l'espérance. Requiem by composer and organist Maurice Duruflé (1902-1986) follows. The concert concludes with Timor et tremor, from Quatre motets pour un temps de pénitence by Francis Poulenc (1899-1963).</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210718/1540170866-Escaich-trois-motets</w></i><x></x></a>
