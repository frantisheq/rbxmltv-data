This episode covers one of Mozart's childhood visit to the British capital (1764-1765), where he and his family were idolized by the royal court and encountered some of the foremost musicians of that time. German Johann Christian Bach (the son of the great Johann Sebastian) and Karl Friedrich Abel (one of the Thomaskantor's prize pupils) had spent significant phases of their musical development in Italy and consequently influenced Mozart's style. In this episode, Vladimir Ashkenazy performs as a soloist and conductor in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 12, KV 414. He is accompanied by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Hampton Court Palace, London.</d></p><i><t>Seriál</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200523/1400271523-Mozart-on-tour-episode-1-london</w></i><x></x></a>
