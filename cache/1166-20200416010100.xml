Maceo has proven his star quality by creating a special chemistry between all the different styles of American black music.

Overheated concert halls, with enthusiastic audiences that completely surrender themselves to the music's boundless energy.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200416/1390152158-Maceo-parker-jazz-a-juan</w></i><x></x></a>
