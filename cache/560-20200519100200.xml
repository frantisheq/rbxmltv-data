Kremer's first recording of these works was released almost a quarter of a century ago. In this recording from 2006, Kremer once again takes on the greatest challenge for any violinist: Bach's magnificent &quot;Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin&quot; (BWV 1001-1006), which Kremer himself calls the &quot;Himalayas&quot; of violin music. With these pieces, Bach firmly established the technical capability of the violin as a solo instrument. The partitas served as archetypes for solo violin pieces by later generations of composers. This rendition of the collection displays Kremer's very personal sense of spontaneity and a readiness to take risks. Yet it is also marked by the structural awareness of an exceptional musician who, in a unique way, does justice both to the polyphonic wealth of the compositions and to their juxtaposition of dance elements and reflective profoundness.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200519/1400171896-Bach-partitas-for-solo-violin-bwv-1001-1006</w></i><x></x></a>
