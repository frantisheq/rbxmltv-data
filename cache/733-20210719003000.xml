On board our expedition ship we arrive to Tucker island, a birdwatcher’s paradise. The area that embraces the archipelagos of Tierra del Fuego and of Cape Horn, are home to 198 species of birds: cormorant colonies, southern gulls and the chimango caracara are everywhere in the sea and the sky, all around us. As soon as we board the practical and fast tender, we try to get as close as possible to the numerous birds sitting on the rocky gorges. But it is on the small beach that we meet the most fascinating part of this second documentary: they are the Magellan penguins, the most common species of penguin in the Straits of Magellan and Tierra del Fuego, places where these birds have chosen to live. We’ll see you in the next episode!!!</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20210719/1540228030-Around-the-world-in-80-islands</w></i><x></x></a>
