The quartet was completed in 1842 and has been described as the &quot;creative double&quot; of Schumann's Piano Quintet, which is also in the key of E-flat major. It is perhaps the most frequently performed piano quartets in the repertoire. The work was composed during Schumann's &quot;Chamber Music Year,&quot; in which he concentrated a whole year on the genre, writing three string quartets and a piano quintet in addition to this piano quartet. This performance is recorded at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebaek, Denmark.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210719/1540193743-Schumann-piano-quartet-op-47</w></i><x></x></a>
