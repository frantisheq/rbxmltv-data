It portrays extraordinary composers who were active in the cultural city of Vienna and deserve the label of genius. In A Dynasty of Dance (Part 5) we follow the lives and work of the Strauss dynasty. Johann Strauss, an orphan at seven and bookbinder until his mid-twenties, introduced the first dance craze the world had ever seen. He fathered three composers: Johann II &quot;The Waltz King,&quot; and Josef and Eduard. Strauss Sr. tried to discourage his sons from following in his footsteps. He and Johann II fought continually until the father's death. Are Johann II's later works a form of filial remorse? Strauss' music is often dismissed as &quot;light music,&quot; but no one can deny the popularity of the Viennese Waltz, even today. The magical city of Vienna became the birthplace of yet one more important musical contribution.</d></p><i><t>Seri√°l</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210713/1540096724-Sons-of-vienna-part-5-dynasty-of-dance</w></i><x></x></a>
