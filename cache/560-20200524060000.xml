This is one of Handel's best-known works, which took only three weeks to compose this oratorio and its famous &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. The work has immense popularity since its premiere in Dublin in 1742, and is often presented at Easter. This performance of the Dutch ensemble Ribattuta Musica under the direction of conductor Dick Duijst was filmed in the grand church of the city of Ermelo, the Netherlands, in 2016. The soloists are Elvire Beekhuizen (soprano), Rosina Fabius (viola), Oscar Verhaar (counter-tenor) Satriya Krisna (tenor), and Hans Voschezang (bass). Ribattuta Musica is a professional ensemble that delivers authentic performances based on current musical practices at the time of the composers.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200524/1400282779-Handel-messiah-hwv-56</w></i><x></x></a>
