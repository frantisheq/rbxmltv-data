It has to go in there, this has to be a song.” Every song has its own story, and we all think it’s a story we’ve heard before, but we haven’t. Songbook finds and captures these intriguing stories by pulling you into the process of writing and composing. Known for its pristine sound, cinematic 4k video and eye for detail, Songbook live-captured episodes emphasize the paramount importance of quality. It addresses the on-the-spot elements of blending song and location at the right moment. Both the magical location and remarkable music interaction will get the attention they deserve. Simply because Songbook isn’t just a live music session, it lives. This episode of Songbook showcases the upbeat pop-rock sound of Dublin-based Wild Youth. The four-piece band, complete with David Whelan (lead vocals), Conor O’Donohoe (keys &amp; backing vocals), Ed Porter (electric guitar &amp; backing vocals) and Callum McAdam (drums) was initially born when main songwriter O'Donohoe began experimenting with the guitar while recovering from an accident. As of today, the band's success is at full display in sold-out headline shows across the UK and Ireland, as well as in supporting major acts such as The Script, Niall Horan and Zara Larsson on arena tours.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20210717/1540267878-Wild-youth-songbook-wild-youth</w></i><x></x></a>
