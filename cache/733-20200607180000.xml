This collection is an invitation to discover more about four common plants and their astonishing properties. Scientists, farmers, economists and sociologists will help us to view the Nettle, the Arabis, the Yew and the Lotus in a different light, as they reveal the plants' uses and new technological, medical, economic and social properties. The collection features interviews with geneticists, the head gardener at the Chateau of Versailles, an Indian industrialist and an Australian botanist, among other professionals, as they invite us into their laboratories, on their expeditions to the ends of the earth, or quite simply, around their gardens. At a time when our society is in full reflection on its relationship to biodiversity, we travel the world to discover in what way these plants have become our partners in life.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200607/1410106673-Plant-secrets-2</w></i><x></x></a>
