It's little wonder, then, that some of Basie's most famous past musicians decided to pay tribute as the Basie Alumni Band. Led by alto saxophonist Marshall Royal, the band features Billy Mitchell (tenor sax) and Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison among others. On this night in the Brussels Jazz Club in 1980, we find the band performing classics such as &quot;Stardust&quot; and &quot;Little Pony&quot; before being joined by legendary singer Joe Williams, who gives us his highly personal take on the blues.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200424/1390322484-Mister-joe-williams-and-the-basie-alumni-band</w></i><x></x></a>
