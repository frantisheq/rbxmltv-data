Success guaranteed when these artists take the stage at the 2016 Easter Concert from the Festspielhaus in Baden-Baden! Honeck, musical director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, made his successful debut with the Berlin Philharmonic in 2013. Yo-Yo Ma has played regularly with the orchestra since 1978. The concert opens with Brahms' Tragic Overture, Op. 81, followed by Schumann's Concerto for Cello, Op. 129. The orchestra concludes with a performance of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 &quot;Path√©tique.&quot; While Schumann's Cello Concerto was never played during his lifetime, Tchaikovsky died just nine days after the premiere of his Symphony No. 6.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210720/1540208924-Easter-concert-in-baden-baden-2016</w></i><x></x></a>
