Its main exposition event has been held in various locations throughout Europe, including Berlin, Brussels, Marseille, Stockholm, Seville, Cardiff, and Budapest. In 2018, WOMEX was held in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria. One of its showcase participants, The Garifuna Collective, carries the legacy of Andy Palacio who not only put the music of Belize on the world stage, it also inspired a generation of Belizean musicians to look to their roots. Featuring an intergenerational line-up and the rousing vocal prowess of the Umalali women singers, they celebrate the deep cultural roots of Garifuna music, with the emblematic sound of the two traditional Garifuna drums – the primero and the segunda – along with maracas, turtle shells, jawbones and acoustic and electric guitars and bass grooves.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200524/1400293492-The-garifuna-collektive-womex-2018</w></i><x></x></a>
