Recorded 2006 at Musikverein Vienna.</k><d>The program is introduced with a short documentation about Schönberg's Pelleas et Melisande, based on a text by Claudio Abbado. Every musical theme relates to a special colour appearing on screen. What has been so remarkable about Abbado's Mahler performances is that their impact has never been achieved at the expense of the multiple sensitivities, subtleties and extreme sophistication. Together with the world's leading youth orchestra – the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester (GMJO) – Abbado performs Mahler's Symphony No. 4 and Schönberg's Pelleas und Melisande, Op. 5. The Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester was founded in Vienna in 1986, by Abbado's initiative. The orchestra's high level of artistic quality and its international success have moved important conductors and soloists to work with the ensemble.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210719/1540193751-Abbado-conducts-mahler-and-schonberg</w></i><x></x></a>
