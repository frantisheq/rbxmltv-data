Symphony No. 4 premiered in Moscow under the baton of Nikolai Rubinstein, just as his Third Symphony. He dedicated this symphony to Nadezhda von Meck. This Russian business woman, who became an influential patron of the arts, mainly in music, supported Tchaikovsky financially so that he could devote his life to composing. They became very close and by dedicating the Fourth Symphony to Nadezhda von Meck, he was affirming her as an equal partner in its creation. This concert features the Mariinsky Orchestra and conductor Valery Gergiev at the Salle Pleyel in Paris. In 2010, all six Tchaikovsky symphonies were recorded by this Russian combination.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210718/1540170870-Tchaikovsky-symphony-no-4-op-36</w></i><x></x></a>
