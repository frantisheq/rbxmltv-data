'Live @ Il Magazzino' is the band's third album since its formation in 2003. The diverse musical backgrounds of the various band members shine through on the album: it is a fusion of jazz, rock, funk, blues and ethnic music. The rousing electric guitar solos by band frontman Matteo Finali are perfectly placed highlights in an excellent ensemble full of natural showmanship, for which he leaves plenty of room for creativity. The result is an intense piece of jazz, with influences just as diverse, original and surprising as Ticino.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210721/1540241249-Final-step-live-il-magazzino-three-sails</w></i><x></x></a>
