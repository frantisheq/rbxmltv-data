After a screening of the King Arthur tale, Axel holds out his sword and declares himself king, but when Dynamo uses his magnetism to steal the weapon and bestow it upon Masko it casts doubt among the team over who is the true leader.</k><d>Axel, a 9-year-old boy who can transform into a living action figure, gains a wild new perspective on the world as he wrangles a team of quirky smart-toys on the biggest small adventures a kid could ever imagine. Life as a toy superhero has its pluses and minuses. On the upside, Axel has massive mecha suit power, a cool energy sword, an impenetrable shield and other abilities he himself hasn’t even discovered yet. Axel is much stronger, more skilled and faster than when he’s his human self. On the downside, toy Axel is only seven-inches tall, and the world around him is no longer adapted to his size: the garden turns into a huge mysterious jungle, a sandbox becomes a desert...! The real world gets a whole lot more complicated and dangerous when Axel sees it from a toy point of view!</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/cartoon-network-en/20210719/1540007985-Power-players-i-16</w></i><x></x></a>
