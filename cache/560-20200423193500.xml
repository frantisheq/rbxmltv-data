During his career he composed over a hundred symphonies which gave him the title 'Father of the Symphony', but he has also been a key figure in the development chamber music such as the piano trio. Haydn is still very famous for his 68 string quartets that he wrote between 1762 and 1803. 'Father of the String Quartet' is therefore also a title that describes Haydn as a composer. The British String Quartet The Lindsays have recorded all substantial Haydn String Quartets during their active years, from 1965 to 2005. Besides Haydn, there are an extensive list of highly praised recordings such as Beethoven String Quartets, but also String Quartets by Mozart, Schubert and Dvorak. In 2004 they recorded six Haydn String Quartets for television at the Kuhmo Arts Centre in Finland. One of them is Haydn's String Quartet in C Major Op. 33 No 3. Opus 33 consists of seven quartets that are most common under the name 'The Russian Quartets', because Haydn dedicated these quartets to Grand Duke Paul of Russia. The quartets premiered on Christmas Day in 1781 and the third quartet is nicknamed 'The Bird'.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200423/1390289969-Haydn-string-quartet-in-c-major-op-33-no-3</w></i><x></x></a>
