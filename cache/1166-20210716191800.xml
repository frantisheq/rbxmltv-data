Its name 'BIRD' refers to the nickname of the legendary New York jazz saxophonist, bebop co-founder Charlie Parker (1920-1955). BIRD serves Neapolitan pizzas, good wines, no-nonsense beers and an all-round metropolitan rawness. Since 2014, this urban jazz club and DJAZZ.tv have been collaborating for a series of music programmes: 'BIRD.tv', allowing you to experience the best BIRD concerts and interviews as from a first row seat! In today's episode, our guest is Snarky Puppys pianist: Bill Laurence!</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210716/1540152271-Birdtv-bill-laurance-project</w></i><x></x></a>
