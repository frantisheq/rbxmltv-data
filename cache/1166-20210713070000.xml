They use a wide array of instruments, including a custom-built 8-string guitar, cuatro, bouzouki, cajón, frame drums, berimbau, udu, and metal percussion instruments, as well as samplers and laptops, adding their own hypnotic vocals to the mix. This concert was recorded at Montréal's Le Bleury Vinyl Bar, near the Place des Festivals, known worldwide as the venue for the Montreal International Jazz Festival.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210713/1540103773-Thomas-carbou-spectacle-au-bleury</w></i><x></x></a>
