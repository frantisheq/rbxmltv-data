They present an all Czech program! We always think of Germany, Austria, and Italy when we name great classical composers, but the Czech Republic also delivered some master composers such as Antonin Dvorák, Bedrich Smetana, Leos Janacek, and Bohuslav Martinu. This concert starts with Smetana's famous Vltava from Má Vlast. Lisa Batiashvili plays Dvorák's Violin Concerto in A minor, and the concerts centerpiece is Dvorák's Symphony No. 6.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210717/1540155423-Dvorak-violin-concerto-in-a-minor-op-53</w></i><x></x></a>
