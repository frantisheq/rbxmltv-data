Alongside Nielsen's inscrutably ironic Symphony No. 6, this performance features world-renowned French pianist Lise de la Salle as soloist in Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 4. This lesser-known concerto saw three separate iterations throughout the composer's life and is characterized by bold chromaticism and a distinctly Jazz-like quality. Luisi and de la Salle have prior experience with this piece, having previously performed and recorded it together. This performance was recorded at the DR Koncerthuset in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2017.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210720/1540208927-Nielsen-commotio</w></i><x></x></a>
