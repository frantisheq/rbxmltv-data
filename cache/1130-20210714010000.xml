Ever wondered what the people of Elmore dream about? As night falls in Elmore the Moon takes us on a tour through the various dreams - and nightmares - of the inhabitants. / Gumball is late to meet Penny at the mall, but a series of misunderstandings on the way only delay him further. / When Mom sees Darwin gazing longingly at a fish-tank she thinks their mammalian lifestyle isn’t fulfilling her adopted son and deep down he longs to connect with his fishy roots. / The Parent Teacher Association of Elmore Junior High bans video games, so the kids try and prove that games aren't a bad influence. / Tobias follows every single high-five with a butt-slap so when Gumball doesn’t get one he feels insulted. He tries to get Tobias to slap his rear all day but it doesn’t work. / Anais arrives in the bedroom to find a messy crime-scene and her Daisy doll missing. She realises Gumball and Darwin are the chief suspects. / A mysterious figure from Nicole's past shows up and challenges her to a fight, but the kids are surprised when she refuses. / A compilation of some of the funniest, most bizarre clips uploaded onto the internet by the people of Elmore.</k></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/cartoon-network-uk/20210714/1540181864-The-amazing-world-of-gumball-iv</w></i><x></x></a>
