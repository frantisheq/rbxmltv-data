Starting in Dallas as a singer and dancer in Alphonso Trent's orchestra, he went to Kansas to form the Texas Bluesicians. At the end of the 1930s, and as a house pianist for the Decca label, he backed many stars, including Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Trixie Smith. Price was equally at home playing the blues in a trio, or leading a bigger band playing the jump-blues people loved to dance to. In this 1958 recording, Sammy plays the Comblain-La-Tour Jazz Festival with his band.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200523/1400280597-Sammy-price-and-his-all-star-orchestra</w></i><x></x></a>
