On the program are Maurice Ravel's Piano Concerto in G Major, as well as two of Montero's own works: the &quot;Latin Concerto&quot; and Improvisations. The performance took place in one of the world's most beautiful concert halls, the Teatro del Lago in Frutillar, located in the middle of the Patagonian plains. The concert hall, which opened its doors in 2010, stands on the banks of Chile's second-largest lake overlooking a volcano that is capped with snow the entire year. In an accompanying interview, Montero speaks about composing, improvising, and performing works of her own alongside those of others. She discusses her home country of Venezuela, where she no longer performs for political reasons.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20210714/1540120428-Gabriela-montero-plays-ravel-montero</w></i><x></x></a>
