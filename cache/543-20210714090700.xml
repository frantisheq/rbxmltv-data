Released in 1991, it single-handedly was responsible for the birth of what became to be known as grunge and has gone on to sell millions. Nirvana's surviving members Krist Novoselic (bass) and Dave Grohl (drums) talk candidly about their past, the recording of Nevermind and about Kurt Cobain and the legacy that he has left behind. Also featured are exclusive interviews with the likes of Garry Gersh(A&amp;R DGC Records), Butch Vig, Jonathan Ponneman and Nils Bernstein(Sub Pop Records), Thurston Moore(Sonic Youth), Jack Endino and many more.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20210714/1540199713-Nirvana-nevermind-classic-albums</w></i><x></x></a>
