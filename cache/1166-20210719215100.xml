His mother a music teacher and his father an Oscar Peterson and Art Blakey enthusiast, Beets was surrounded by music from an early age. And though music was in their blood, neither parent associated the word &quot;musician&quot; with a career. In this broadcast, Peter Beets teams up with Anton Goudsmit (guitar) in tribute to guitar icon and founding father of modern jazz Wes Montgomery. The two men share a passion for Montgomery's music, his compositions forming the basis for Goudsmit's energetic and eccentric solos and Beets's virtuoso piano playing. They are backed by a grooving rhythm section featuring Marius Beets (bass) and Joost van Schaik (drums).</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20210719/1540202315-Peter-beets-trio-goudsmit-tribute-to-montgomery</w></i><x></x></a>
