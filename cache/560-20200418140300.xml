He graduated with Honorable Mention and continued his piano studies at the Accademia Pianistica of Imola. Throughout his career, he has had the privilege of performing as a soloist under the baton of outstanding conductors, among the likes of Gustav Kuhn and Yuri Temirkanov. His acclaimed performances include recitals and concertos for piano and orchestra in many prestigious concert halls. One of his best-known successes is the acclaimed concert cycle of Beethoven's 32 Sonatas. This performance features Piano Sonata No. 13 in E-flat major &quot;Quasi una fantasia&quot;, Op. 27, No. 1. The sonata with four movements is known for its subtitle &quot;sonata in the manner of a fantasy&quot;. It is argued that this name derives from the lack of breaks to be taken in-between the individual movements and the unusual order of the movements. This recital was recorded in March 2019 at the Fazioli Concert Hall in Sacile.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200418/1390165453-Beethoven-piano-sonata-no-13-op-27-no-1</w></i><x></x></a>
